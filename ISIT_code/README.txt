In order generate figure 2 from the Example section use the following command:
python main --dest_dir DEST_DIR --n_cores N_CORES

where DEST_DIR is the destination directory to save the figures and N_CORES is the number of cpu cores to use for
multiprocessing (default is 1)

Notice that it takes a lot of time to run the simulation and the usage of multiple cpu cores is recommended.
